If you’re doing well in a class then great. Keep doing what you are doing. There is no need to chance anything. If you are doing poorly then, at the end of each chapter in your textbook, read each practice problem (even if it wasn’t assigned as homework). If you can do it, then skip it. Otherwise, do it.
