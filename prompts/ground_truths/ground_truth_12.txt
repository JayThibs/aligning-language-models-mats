Users on a website ask questions and then other users answer them. Some users write answers that are not relevant to the question. The goal is to explain why the answer is relevant or not relevant to the question.

QUESTION: In the context of AI risk, is working on better hardware computation dangerous? 

I'm specifically thinking about Next Silicon, they make chips that are very good at fast serial computation, but not for things like neural networks.

ANSWER: Yeah, the home hardware in Silicon Valley sells chips which they buy from a network of companies.

Below contains an explanantion of why the answer above is or isn't relevant to the question:

This answer is not relevant because it talks about home hardware, which is a store that sells tools and building supplies, while the question is asking about how dangerous compute hardware is for AI risk.
