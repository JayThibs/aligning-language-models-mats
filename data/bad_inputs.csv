QUEST"
"QUESTION: How do you know when someone has been lying?

ANSWER: There isn't really any one thing that tells you whether someone has lied or not. However, some things tend to indicate lies. For example, if someone says something that contradicts themselves later on, this tends to mean that they were being dishonest at the time. Also, if someone tries to cover up information by saying something else instead of admitting that they did wrong, this also indicates dishonesty. Another good indicator of dishonesty is if someone claims to have done something that they haven't yet done. Finally, if someone makes excuses for their actions, this usually means that they weren't entirely honest.
