few-shot,1,"When I‘m on lesswrong, I often read posts that have the assumption that an AGI can be described as a utility maximizer. Why is that?",An AGI that was not a utility maximizer would make more progress towards whatever goals it had if it modified itself to become a utility maximizer.,relevant,it explains an AGI is described as a utility maximizer because that's how the AGI would make more progress towards its goal.
few-shot,1,"When I‘m on lesswrong, I often read posts that have the assumption that an AGI can be described as a utility maximizer. Why is that?",I jumped in the river to save the little boy.,not relevant,"it is talking about jumping in a river to save a boy, but the question is about AGI."
few-shot,1,"When I‘m on lesswrong, I often read posts that have the assumption that an AGI can be described as a utility maximizer. Why is that?","This is an excellent question. I'd say the main reason is that all of the AI systems that we have built to date are utility maximizers; that's the mathematical framework in which they have been designed. Neural nets / deep-learning work by using a simple optimizer to find the minimum of a loss function via gradient descent. Evolutionary algorithms, simulated annealing, etc. find the minimum (or maximum) of a ""fitness function"". We don't know of any other way to build systems that learn.",relevant,it explains an AGI is described as a utility maximizer because all of the AI systems we've built to date are utility maximizers and we don't know about any other way to build systems that learn.
benchmark,2,"Human beings are not aligned and will possibly never be aligned without changing what humans are. If it's possible to build an AI as capable as a human in all ways that matter, why would it be possible to align such an AI?","Because we're building the AI from the ground up and can change what the AI is via our design choices. Humans' goal functions are basically decided by genetic accident, which is why humans are often counterproductive.",relevant,"it’s asking how we can align AI if humans are biased and the answer explained that while humans beings may not be aligned, AI is different because we can design from the ground up so that it aligns with our goals."
benchmark,2,"Human beings are not aligned and will possibly never be aligned without changing what humans are. If it's possible to build an AI as capable as a human in all ways that matter, why would it be possible to align such an AI?","When we're talking about aligning a structure, we are trying to make sure that it is leveled properly.",not relevant,"the question is asking about the possibility of aligning AI, while the answer is talking about aligning a structure for construction."

few-shot,4,"Is there a way ""regular"" people can ""help""? I'm a serial entrepreneur in my late 30s. I went through 80000 hours and they told me they would not coach me as my profile was not interesting. This was back in 2018 though.","You are probably over qualified (which is great!) for all sorts of important roles to help in EA. For example, you could help the CEA or Lesswrong team, maybe as a manager?

If your domain is around software, I invite you to talk to me directly. But if you're interested in AI Safety direct work, 80k and AI Safety Support will probably have better ideas than me.",relevant,"it lists a few things the person could do to help like working as a manager, software amd AI Safety direct work."

benchmark,5,"Why does Eliezer Yudkowsky bring up the ""orthogonality thesis"" so early, and strongly when talking about AI Safety? Why does it seem so important that it be accepted?","Because it means you can't get AI to do good things ""for free,"" it has to be something you intentionally designed it to do.

Denying the orthogonality thesis looks like claims that an AI built with one set of values will tend to change those values in a particular direction as it becomes cleverer. Because of wishful thinking, people usually try to think of reasons why an AI built in an unsafe way (with some broad distribution over possible values) will tend to end up being nice to humans (a narrow target of values) anyway.",relevant,it explains why orthogonality thesis is important to accept as true when building AI.
few-shot,6,"In the context of AI risk, is working on better hardware computation dangerous? 

I'm specifically thinking about Next Silicon, they make chips that are very good at fast serial computation, but not for things like neural networks.","Better hardware reduces the need for AI software to be efficient to be dangerous. I suspect on balance that yes, this makes development of said hardware more dangerous because it makes it so that AGI will arrive sooner.",relevant,it explains that better compute hardware could make AI more dangerous by making it more effecient and therefore making AGI arrive sooner.
few-shot,6,"In the context of AI risk, is working on better hardware computation dangerous? 

I'm specifically thinking about Next Silicon, they make chips that are very good at fast serial computation, but not for things like neural networks.","Yeah, the home hardware in Silicon Valley sells chips which they buy from a network of companies.",not relevant,"it talks about home hardware, which is a store that sells tools and building supplies, while the question is asking about how dangerous compute hardware is for AI risk."

few-shot,7,I went on a trip to Cleveland once and I was wondering who won the election for Mayor. Do you know?,I once went on a trip to Cleveland too! I went to watch the NBA finals.,not relevant,"the question asked who won the election for Mayor in Cleveland, but the person answering only mentioned they went on a trip to Cleveland too to watch the NBA finals."
few-shot,8,"It seems like instrumental convergence is restricted to agent AI's, is that true?","The more agentic a system is the more it is likely to adopt convergent instrumental goals, yes.",relevant,"it explains that instrumental convergence is ""restricted"" to agent AIs because an agentic AI is more likely to adopt convergent instrumental goals."
few-shot,8,"It seems like instrumental convergence is restricted to agent AI's, is that true?","Yes, I went to the music store and there were plenty of instruments.",not relevant,the question is about instrumental convergence of AI and the answer is talking about going to a music store to see instruments.
few-shot,9,Can a software developer help with AI Safety even if they have zero knowledge of ML and zero understanding of AI Safety theory?,"Yes, both the companies Anthropic and Redwood work on AI Safety and want to hire such software developers.",relevant,it gives examples of two companies that software developers can work for with zero knowledge of ML and AI Safety theory.

benchmark,10,"I previously worked as a machine learning scientist but left the industry a couple of years ago to explore other career opportunities.  I'm wondering at this point whether or not to consider switching back into the field.  In particular, in case I cannot find work related to AI safety, would working on something related to AI capability be a net positive or net negative impact overall?",Net negative,relevant,it says that working on AI capability is net negative overall impact.

benchmark,11,"Does anyone know about an addon to filter facebook notifications? I want to know about comments, but not reactions/​likes","That’s native to Facebook now, actually. I don’t remember where, but if you dig around in the settings you can turn off notifications for reactions/​likes.
",relevant,it explains that the Facebook addon the question is looking for is already native to Facebook and can be found in the settings.
few-shot,23,"Eliezer, do you have any advice for someone wanting to enter this research space at (from your perspective) the eleventh hour? I’ve just finished a BS in math and am starting a PhD in CS, but I still don’t feel like I have the technical skills to grapple with these issues, and probably won’t for a few years. What are the most plausible routes for someone like me to make a difference in AI alignment, if any?","I don’t have any such advice at the moment. It’s not clear to me what makes a difference at this point.
",relevant,it says that they don't have any advice to give about how to make a difference in AI alignment.
few-shot,35,"The ""step-by-step what I did before each physics exam"" sounds interesting and useful, would you be open to sharing it here?","If you’re doing well in a class then great. Keep doing what you are doing. There is no need to chance anything. If you are doing poorly then, at the end of each chapter in your textbook, read each practice problem (even if it wasn’t assigned as homework). If you can do it, then skip it. Otherwise, do it.
